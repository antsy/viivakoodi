Generates bar codes for bank transfers.

Wrote this in a hurry, hoping that maybe some day in the future I'll get my time back when someone includes virtual barcode in their bill.

See [test.php](test.php) for usage example.

## Printed barcodes?

The purpose of this was only to support virtual barcodes, but if you want those actual zebra stripes there are dozens of implementations available, just use the "Code 128" specification.
